## What is Color Hunt?

Color Hunt is a collection of color palettes that you can use in your designs.

## Why this plugin?

Color Hunt has no integration with Figma. It can be very annoying to copy and paste Color Hunt colors one by one into your designs. This plugin allows you to quickly import palettes from Color Hunt and create your color styles by simply copying and pasting the palette ID.
